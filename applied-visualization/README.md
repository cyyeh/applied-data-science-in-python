# Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

## Overview

This course will introduce the learner to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course will start with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. The second week will focus on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. The third week will be a tutorial of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. The course will end with a discussion of other forms of structuring and visualizing data. 

## Key Concepts by Week

Week 1
- Interpret the features of the graphic in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the "encoder" to mislead the "decoder"
- Choose a graphic that displays misleading information
- Analyze the graphic and use principles from Alberto Cairo's work to explain how the graphic is misleading
- Create a radar plot in order to reflect on the complexity of the misleading graphic

Week 2
- Know how to create a line graph using matplotlib
- Work with real world CSV data
- Manipulate data to get the minimum and maximum temperature
- Demonstrate procedure of composite charts

Week 3
- Build more complex features using base features (i.e., artists)
- Create new ways of visualizing the data by expanding the matplotlib codebase
- Create animated and interactive visualizations
- Create insightful plots such as histograms, box plots, and histograms
- Use subplots to combine plots into a single figure

Week 4
- State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets
- Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension
- Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question
- Justify how the visual addresses your research question
