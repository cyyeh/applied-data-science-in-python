# Applied Text Mining in Python

## Overview

This course will introduce the learner to text mining and text manipulation basics. The course begins with an understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. The second week focuses on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week will apply basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. The final week will explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling).

## Key Concepts by Week

Week 1, Working with Text in Python

- Interpret text in terms of its basic building blocks: sentences and words.
- Identify common problems with raw text and perform text cleaning tasks in Python.
- Write regular expressions to find textual patterns.

Week 2, Basic Natural Language Processing

- Describe different natural language tasks.
- Process free text through the NLTK toolkit to tag language constructs onto text.
- Derive meaningful features from text.

---

Week 3, Classification of Text

- Classify text in two classes using one of these approaches in Python
- Identify and extract features from text and transform them into feature vectors for the machine learning models
- Compare text classification to other classification approaches (covered in Applied Machine Learning in Python as well)
- Describe the Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms

Week 4, Topic Modeling

- Apply WordNet-based similarity measures on text
- Derive semantic topics from a large text collection using LDA
- List and describe techniques for named entity recognition and other information extraction tasks.
